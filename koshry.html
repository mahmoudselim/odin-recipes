    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Koshari has developed in recent times in Egypt, where the number of Koshari restaurants has increased. 
        These shops also serve other foods besides Koshari, such as pasta dishes, rice with milk, and pancakes. 
        Koshari is one of the most popular Egyptian dishes, and it consists of pasta, rice, black lentils, fried onions, tomato sauce, and frying. 
        Koshari is a low-cost, high-calorie meal with oxidised vegetable oils due to frying. 
        It is rare to find an Egyptian who does not like Egyptian Koshari (Kushari).</p>
    <p>
        He may be the first to mention Koshari in history, and he is Ibn Battuta (died 1377 AD) in his book “Tuhfat al-Nazar fi Gharib al-Missar and Ajaab al-Travel”. 
        Any proof that the Indian dish is related to Koshari, as the Indian dish contains rice and lentils only. 
        The Egyptian Koshari contains many ingredients in addition to the Egyptian sauce and other distinctive additions. 
        With a combo of a myriad of nutritional and flavorful ingredients, this Egyptian Koshari (Kushari) recipe takes you to a short trip to Egypt to try one of the most popular affordable Egyptian recipes that you can ever find, Koshari.
